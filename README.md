### Background
This project is written in HTML, CSS, JS to answer the [Tic-tac-toe problem](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
My goal was to make a simple and minimalistic game with a clean UI where players can play right away without any prompts.
This is a simple PvP implementation, with AI option to be added in the future.

### Project Requirments

 - ‚úîÔ∏è The main goal here is to have as little global code as possible. Try tucking everything away inside of a module or factory.
 - ‚úîÔ∏è Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage.
 - ‚úîÔ∏è Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker. Don‚Äôt forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!
 - ‚úîÔ∏è Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
 - üîπ Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player! - Decided to keep the game simple without extra promps, included restart button but no need for start in my implementation.
 - ‚≠ê Optional - If you‚Äôre feeling ambitious create an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
 
### Where I struggled

 - Workign with SVG rather than typed X and O.
 - Avoiding global code.

### What I Learned

 - Utilizing an object and more funtions to better style the code.
 - How to work with SVGs.
 - How to better manipulate DOM elements.
